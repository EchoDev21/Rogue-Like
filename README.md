# Rogue-Like - Untitled Pirate Game

# Summary
A Top-Down/Rogue-Like/Adventure/Bullet-hell game, where you play as a pirate I guess. 
Fight your way to treasure, explore the world, but don't die. 
You'll start over from the beginning.
# Milestones
Milestones help me stay on track, and kind of figure out the direction of the game. Every 7 days I'll update this.
